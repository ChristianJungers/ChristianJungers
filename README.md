# Christian Jungers | Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity project portfolio! I'm Christian Jungers, an aspiring SOC Analyst with a strong foundation in IT and a passion for protecting digital assets. With a background in cybersecurity fundamentals and hands-on experience through labs and self-directed projects, I'm actively building my skill set in threat detection, vulnerability management, and incident response.

I'm currently working toward my goal of landing a SOC Analyst role by consistently applying what I learn in realistic, lab-based environments. I hold the **CompTIA Security+** and **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**, and I’m dedicated to continuous growth in the field.
